## What happens if there is a problem with my credit card?
If there is a problem charging your credit card, you will see a notification banner at the top of the site when you log in. After the initial issue charging your card, we will make 2 retry attempts to charge the card. If they all fail, your account status will be set to canceled and you'll need to re-activate with a valid credit card. 

When your account is set to canceled, you will have only observer (read-only) access to your content. This means you'll still be able to view your files, but you will no longer be able to edit them. Adding a valid card and activating the account will make the account active again and you'll be able to resume writing and editing your work.
