### As an invited user do I have to pay for my subscription? 
No. Project collaborators do not have to pay to work on another person or organization's projects in Beegit. When you're invited to collaborate on a project, the owner of that project pays for you to participate with them. 

### Can I create content projects I own after being invited to someone else's projects? 
Yes. Once you are invited to collaborate on someone else's project, and you activate your account, you will start a 30-day free trial on a personal account as well. During this trial, you can create your own projects and add in or invite team members to collaborate on your projects. At the end of your trial, however, if you want to keep working on projects you own, you will have to pay for a monthly subscription. 

Regardless of whether or not you pay for your own account, you will always be able to collaborate on projects other users own for free
