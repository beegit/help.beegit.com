### As an invited user do I have to pay for my subscription? 
No. Collaborators do not have to pay to work on another person or organization's projects in Beegit. When you're invited to join someone else's team, the owner of that project pays for you to participate with them. 

### Can I create content projects I own after being invited to someone else's projects? 
Yes. Once you are invited to collaborate on someone else's project, and you activate your account, you will also have a free individual account for your use. If you want to invite others to collaborate on your own projects, you will have to upgrade to a team plan or start a free trial. 

Regardless of whether or not you pay for your own account, you will always be able to collaborate on projects owned by others for free
