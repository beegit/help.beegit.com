## What happens after I cancel my subscription?
Canceled subscriptions stay active until the next billing cycle date. 

After that, your card will not be charged again and your subscription will expire. You will be asked to enter a valid credit card or convert your account to a free individual plan. You'll still be able to access and edit your projects, but your team will no longer be able to edit them. Adding a valid card will reactivate the subscription. 

When you cancel, your billing page will indicate that the subscription will be canceled by displaying the following message in red: "Your subscription is set to cancel on MM/DD/YYYY."
