## What happens if there is a problem with my credit card?
If there is a problem charging your credit card, you will see a notification banner at the top of the site when you log in. After the initial issue charging your card, we will make 2 retry attempts to charge the card. If they all fail, your subscription status will be set to canceled and you'll need to reactivate with a valid credit card. 

When your subscription is set to canceled, the subscription will expire and you will be asked to enter a valid credit card or convert your account to a free individual plan. You'll still be able to access and edit your projects, but your team will no longer be able to edit them. Adding a valid card will reactivate the subscription.
