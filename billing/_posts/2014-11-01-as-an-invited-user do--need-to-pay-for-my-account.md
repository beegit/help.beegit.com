### As an invited user do I have to pay for my subscription? 
No. Project collaborators do not have to pay to work on another person or organization's projects in Beegit. When you're invited to collaborate on a project, the owner of that project pays for you to participate with them. 

### Can I create content projects I own after being invited to someone else's projects? 
Yes. Once you are invited to collaborate on someone else's project, and you activate your account, you will start a 14-day free trial. During this trial you can create your own projects and add in or invite team members to collaborate on your projects. After your trial, however, you will be charged $10/month per team member with the role of admin or editor on all the projects you own.
