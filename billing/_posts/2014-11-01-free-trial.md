## How does the free trial work?
When you sign up for Beegit, you can choose a team plan and start a no obligation, free trial. You do not have to enter your credit card information to create a trial account. 

[Team plans](https://beegit.com/pricing) are based on the number of active users on your team and are meant to help you pay only for what you use. You can also sign up for a free individual plan. Once you sign up, you'll be able to invite in your team members and create as many projects and as much content as you'd like. 

Throughout your free trial, there will be a notification banner at the top of the site reminding you how many days remain on your trial. You will also receive email reminders detailing how much time you have left. 

Once your trial is over, you will be required to pay for the team plan you've selected. 

If your trial ends and you don't have a valid credit card on file --- and you aren't on the individual plan --- the subscription will expire and you will be asked to enter a valid credit card or convert your account to a free individual plan. You'll still be able to access and edit your projects, but your team will no longer be able to edit them. Adding a valid card will reactivate the subscription. 

### How does the free trial work if I'm an invited collaborator? 
You will always be able to collaborate on projects owned by others for free. 

You will also be given a free individual account for your use. If you want to invite others to collaborate on your own projects, you will have to upgrade to a team plan or start a free trial.
