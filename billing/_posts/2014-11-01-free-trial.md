## How does the free trial work?
When you sign up for Beegit, you will have a 30-day free trial. You do not have to enter your credit card information for this free trial. 

When you sign up for your free trial, you will be asked to choose a [subscription plan](https://beegit.com/pricing) that works for you. Plans are set based on the number of active users on your team and are meant to help you pay only for what you use. Once you sign up, you'll be able to invite in your team members and create as many projects and as much content as you'd like. 

Throughout your free trial, there will be a notification banner at the top of the site reminding you how many days remain on your trial. You will also receive email reminders detailing how much time you have left. 

Once your trial is over, you will be charged for the subscription plan you've selected. 

If your trial ends and you don't have a valid credit card on file, the subscription will expire and your content will be put into read-only mode. You'll still be able to view and export your files, but you will no longer be able to edit them. Adding a valid card will reactivate the subscription. 

### How does the free trial work if I'm an invited collaborator? 
If you're invited to collaborate on someone else's projects, you will not be charged for work you do on that owner's projects. 

When you activate your account, however, you will be given a 30-day free trial where you can make projects that you own. If you create any projects you own during that trial, you will be charged for a subscription when your trial ends.
