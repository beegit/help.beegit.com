## How does the free trial work?
When you sign up for Beegit you will have a 14-day unlimited free trial. During this trial you can create as many projects as you like and add in as many collaborators as you'd like. 

Throughout your free trial, there will be a notification banner at the top of the site reminding you how many days remain on your trial. You will also receive email reminders detailing how much time you have left. 

Once your trial is over, you will be charged $10/month for your account and $10/month for every collaborator with the status of admin or editor on projects you own. 

If your free trial ends and you don't have a valid credit card on file, the account will be set to expired and your content will be put into observer mode. This means you'll still be able to view your files, but you will no longer be able to edit them. Adding a valid card will make the account to active again and you'll be able to resume writing and editing work. 

### How does the free trial work if I'm an invited collaborator? 
If you're invited to collaborate on someone else's projects, you will not be charged for work you do on that owner's projects. 

When you activate your account, however, you will be given a 14-day free trial where you can make projects that you own. If you create any projects you own during that trial --- and invite any collaborators --- you will be charged for that account when your trial ends.
