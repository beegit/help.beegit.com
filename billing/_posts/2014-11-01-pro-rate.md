## Are collaborators added during a billing cycle prorated?
Yes. All new team members are prorated and executed on the billing cycle date once per month. This means you will not be charged for a full month of usage for someone you added partway through a billing cycle. 

For example: An account has 2 team members and the billing cycle starts on the 1st of each month. A third team member is added on June 15th. On July 1st, The account will be billed $25. This is $10 for each of the first two team members, and a prorated amount of $5 for the newly-added team member from the 15th to the 30th.

When you transition a team member with the role of observer to an editor or admin, the $10 charge will be prorated from that date. When inviting a new team member to your Beegit projects as an editor or admin, the $10 charge will be pro-rated from the date when the team member activates their account.
