## How does the billing cycle work? 
Beegit charges valid credit cards on a monthly billing cycle. Once per month project owners will be charged $10 for their account and $10 each for their collaborators holding the user role of admin or editor.

Users added during a billing cycle are pro-rated. Existing collaborators will be pro-rated from the day they are given the user role of admin or editor. New collaborators you invite to Beegit will be billed from the day they activate their account.
