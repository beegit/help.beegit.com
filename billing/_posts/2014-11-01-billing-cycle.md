## How does the billing cycle work? 
Beegit charges valid credit cards on a monthly billing cycle. When you sign up for your free trial, you will be asked to choose a [monthly subscription plan](https://beegit.com/pricing). At the end of your 30-day free trial, if you've added a valid credit card and you're on a group plan, your first payment will process. 

If you are an individual user, your account is free and you do not need to add a credit card.
