## How do I cancel my subscription?
You can cancel your subscription by going to the billing tab inside your [account settings](https://beegit.com/settings/billing).

Canceled subscriptions stay active until the next billing cycle date. The user will not be charged again and will enter observer mode (meaning all files will be read-only) on that date. The user's billing page will indicate that the subscription will be canceled by displaying the following message in red: "Your subscription is set to cancel on MM/DD/YYYY."
