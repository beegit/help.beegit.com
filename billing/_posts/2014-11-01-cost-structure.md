## How do you charge for Beegit?
Project owners in Beegit are charged for their subscription and the number of collaborators they have with a user role of editor or admin. The cost is $10/month per collaborator. They are not charged for the number of projects they create or the amount of content they create. 

A subscription will be charged $10/month for each collaborator that holds the role of editor or admin on the collaborator list, even if they are set to observer status on one or select projects. 

A subscription will not be charged for any collaborator who exclusively holds the role of observer. So an account with with an owner, 3 editors and 3 observers would be charged $40/month: $10 for the project owner, $30 for the editors and $0 for the observers. 

As new collaborators are added during the billing cycle, the charge for their use will be prorated. 

### Is there an option for an annual plan or a custom price for larger teams? 
We can create a custom plan for annual payment or teams larger than 20. Email us at [support@beegit.com](mailto:support@beegit.com) and we'll get you started.
