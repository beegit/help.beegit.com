## How do you charge for Beegit?
Project owners in Beegit are charged monthly for the [group subscription plan](https://beegit.com/pricing) that they select. They are not charged for the number of projects they create or the amount of content they create. Users on the individual plan are free. 

Every group plan comes with a soft cap on active team members. That means that if you have the Business plan, which allows for 10 team members, and you go over that, you will not immediately be charged and your service will not be interrupted. If you stay at the larger team size for a full billing cycle, we will reach out to you and ask you to upgrade your plan.

### How does the free individual plan work? 
If you're working by yourself, you can use Beegit for free. When you sign up, you'll be given a 30-day unlimited trial of the software. During this trial, you can add in collaborators. Once the trial is over, your account will continue to be free, but if you want to keep any team members active, you'll have to change to a paid group plan. 

### Is there an option for an annual plan or a custom price for larger teams? 
Yes. We are happy to create a custom plan for annual payment or for teams larger than 20. Email us at [support@beegit.com](mailto:support@beegit.com) and we'll get you started.
