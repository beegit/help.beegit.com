## How do you charge for Beegit?
Project owners in Beegit are charged monthly for the [subscription plan](https://beegit.com/pricing) that they select. They are not charged for the number of projects they create or the amount of content they create. 

Each plan comes with a soft cap on active users. That means that if you have the Business plan, which allows for 10 active users, and you go over that, you will not immediately be charged and your service will not be interrupted. If you stay at the larger team size for a full billing cycle, we will reach out to you and ask you to upgrade your plan.

### Is there an option for an annual plan or a custom price for larger teams? 
We can create a custom plan for annual payment or teams larger than 20. Email us at [support@beegit.com](mailto:support@beegit.com) and we'll get you started.
