## How do you charge for Beegit?
Project owners in Beegit are charged for their account and the number of collaborators they have with the user role of editor or admin. The cost is $10/month per collaborator. They are not charged for the number of projects they create or the amount of content they create. 

An account will be charged $10/month for each collaborator holds the role of editor or admin on the collaborator list, even if they are set to observer status on one or select projects. 

An account will not be charged for any collaborator who exclusively has the status of observer. So an account with with an owner, 3 editors and 3 observers would be charged $40/month: $10 for the project owner, $30 for the editors and $0 for the collaborators. 

As new collaborators are added during the billing cycle, the charge for their use will be pro-rated.
