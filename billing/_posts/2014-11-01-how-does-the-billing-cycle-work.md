## How does the billing cycle work? 
Beegit charges valid credit cards on a monthly billing cycle for team plans. When you sign up for a free trial of a [paid team plan](https://beegit.com/pricing), you can start collaborating right away without a credit card. At the end of your free trial, if you've added a valid credit card, your first payment will process. If not, you will directed to add in a valid credit card or convert your account to a free individual plan. 

Credit cards are not required to start a free trial of a paid team plan.
