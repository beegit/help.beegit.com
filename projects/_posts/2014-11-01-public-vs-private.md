## What is the difference between a public and a private project? 
When you create a project you'll have two options for its visibility: public or private 

### Public projects 
Public projects are meant to be shared with non-Beegit users. You can share the link to any file inside the project and people will be able to view it as a read-only document. You still have control over the collaborator list and no public viewers will be able to change your project or settings. 

### Private projects 
Private projects are visible only to logged in Beegit users invited by project owners or admins to collaborate on that project. A link to any file inside that project shared with a non-invited user will not work.
