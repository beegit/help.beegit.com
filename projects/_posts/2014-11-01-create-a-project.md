## How do I create a project?
To make a project to house all your content on an account you own or are an admin on, you can hit the [create a project](https://beegit.com/new) link in the top navigation of the site. You can also hit the `Create Project` button on you dashboard to create a project you own. 

### Setting up a project 
When you create a new project, you'll be able to set up some basics that will let your project collaborators know what they're working on.

First, choose a project name. This name will display on the dashboard with everyone on the project. 

Next, choose a project type - public or private. Public projects let you choose who can edit them, but they can be viewed as read-only documents by users outside of Beegit. Private projects let you control visibility to only your collaborator access list.

To help identify the project even more, you can create a short description of the project that will show up on the dashboard of everyone on the project. 

Finally, select a color for the project. The color options let you create a workflow by tying a priority or project type to a color. Project collaborators can then sort by and see projects by color on their dashboard.
