## How do I export to InDesign?
One of the options for exporting a file in Beegit is to InDesign. This is a workflow process that keeps designers from making text changes inside production files and ensures that the latest versions of the content files are always up-to-date and in a centralized location.

Using this export takes advantage of InDesign's ICML (InCopy Markup Language) functionality. It lets you drop content into a layout using the same process as placing an image or graphic. This is beneficial because the content is not embedded in the file (like it would be through a copy and paste). This makes updating the content from the master copy becomes incredibly simple.
