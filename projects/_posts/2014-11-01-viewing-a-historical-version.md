## How do I view a historical version?
One of the biggest benefits of adding versioning to your workflow is that you'll never lose an old version of your work and always have it as a reference. Beegit supports this by providing a `Browse Version Files` button when you're viewing a version from your version history. With this feature, you can not only view how a given file looked at any point in time, but also how the whole project looked at that point in time.

To browse a historical version of your files, navigate to the Versions tab in your project and select a version. Click the `Browse Version Files` button to switch to historical mode and begin viewing a snapshot of what your entire project looked like when that version was created.

### Working with historical versions and files
Once you've entered historical version mode, you'll be navigated back to the same file tree you're familiar with. The difference is that the file tree is now showing you a set of read-only files (you can't change the past) of what your project files looked like at the time of the version you selected. The header area also indicates that you're in historical version mode and gives you the name of the person who made this version, along with the date it was committed. Navigate around the file tree and enjoy your old file content.

### Leaving historical mode
When you're ready to leave historical mode and switch back to the current version of your project, use the `Switch to Current Version` button under the main navigation.
