## How do I export my content ?
Inside the editor for any project you can export your individual files out of Beegit into multiple formats. You can find the export options by clicking on the `Exported Selected File` icon above the file tree.

You can export your content into the following formats: 

* Markdown 
* HTML 
* Word 
* InDesign 
* ePub 

You can also copy HTML directly to your clipboard by selecting that option in the editor.

### Exporting a project or set of selected files 
For now, you can only export one file at a time out of Beegit using the export feature. A project compile option for export is coming in a future release of Beegit. If your organization has a request for help exporting a large project from Beegit, please contact us at [support@beegit.com](mailto:support@beegit.com).
