## How do I make a version of my work?
A version is a milestone or a hand-off point in your work. When you write or edit a file in a project in Beegit, you'll see the Versions tab change to orange. That means you have changes you can commit to a version. 

To create a version, click on the versions tab. You'll see a view of all the files that have changed. You can select the View details link on any of them to see what was added and deleted on that file. You'll also be able to see who made changes to that file. As you review the files that changed, you can choose which ones to include in a version. 

### Creating a version note 
When you're creating a version, you need to create a note to go with that version. That note will show up in the version history for the project so anyone can review the project progress. You can also @mention specific collaborators in a version to ensure that they get an email notification calling the version to their attention.

### Commit the version 
When you've selected the files you want to include in the version and created a note to mark this version, you can hit the `Make New Version` button to commit your version to the system. This version will exist as long as the project is in the system and you'll always be able to return to it to see the note and the files as they existed during this version.
