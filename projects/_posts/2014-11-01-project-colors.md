## What do the project colors do?
Projects can be assigned one of seven different colors to help identify them. Many teams use these colors as a way to help sort or prioritize their projects. The selected color shows up next to the project on your dashboard and inside the project. 

The default color for every project is gray, but that can be changed when a project is created or updated in the project settings by a project owner, admin or editor.
