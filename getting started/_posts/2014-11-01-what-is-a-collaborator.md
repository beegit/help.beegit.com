## What is a collaborator? 
A collaborator is someone who works on any project with you. If you're the owner of a project, you can set their user role to observer, editor or admin. You can also decide on their default email notification settings. Project owners will be required to pay for the subscriptions of their collaborators. 

If you've been invited to a project, your user role has been set by the project owner. 

### Making a project team 
If you have a team you work with on every project you own, you can set those users to automatically be added to every new project you create in the global collaborators section on your dashboard. 

### Adding collaborators to a project 
If there are collaborators you only want to involve in certain projects, add them using the global collaborator section on your dashboard. Set their role and then choose no when asked if you want to add them to every project. After you add that user, they will be available on your global collaborator list and you can invite them to any specific project inside that project's collaborator section.
