## What is a version? 
Everything you type in Beegit's editor is autosaved as you work. But when you're at a stopping point, you can make a version that will exist in the project forever. 

A version is like a milestone or a hand-off point in your work. When you create a version, you'll be able to leave a note for yourself or project collaborators describing what you've done. You can even @mention specific project collaborators so they get an email notification about this version. Before you make your version, you can review the differences on every file you touched. They'll show words that you added highlighted in green and words that you deleted highlighted in red. 

Once you commit a version, it's in the system forever and you'll always be able to go back and look at the changes, the note and the files and folders as they existed at that time.
