## How do I set up Beegit for my team?
Beegit is a centralized location to write, manage and measure all of your content projects. To get started, create an account you, your organization or your business owns. Most teams do this with a house email account like an info@ address. It can also be a person's email address, if that's your preference. 

Whoever creates this account will own all of the content in Beegit and will have the ability to control user roles, subscriptions, the global collaborator list and the decision to delete projects. 

Once this account is created, you can add in collaborators to help with your projects or get started on your first project. 

### Centralize your content in a new project 
Once you've created your Beegit account, you can log in and [create a project](https://beegit.com/new). A project is a centralized place of activity for the content built around a specific goal, deadline or production cycle. It can be anything from an issue of a publication to new copy for your company's website. This project will have its own life cycle, with metrics, notifications and version history tied to it. 

### Invite and manage collaborators 
Most content projects require other people to help create, edit, revise or approve the work. Once you have your account created, you can add in collaborators to all of your projects or to a specific project. 

You can manage your usual team or department using the [global collaboration list](https://beegit.com/collaborators) on your dashboard. You can set team members to be added to every new project you create and set their user roles to observer, editor or admin. You can also set their default email notifications on this dashboard. Additionally, you can create collaborators for this list and then invite to join only specific projects using the collaborator section inside that project.
