## How do I set up Beegit for my team?
Beegit is a centralized location to write, manage and measure all of your content projects. To get started, create an account you, your organization or your business owns. Most users do this with a house email account like an info@ address. It can also be a person's email address, if that's your preference. 

Whoever creates this account will own all of the content in Beegit and will have the ability to control user roles, subscriptions, the team list and the decision to delete projects. 

Once this account is created, you can add in your team members to help with your projects or get started on your first project. 

### Centralize your content in a new project 
Once you've created your Beegit account, you can log in and [create a project](https://beegit.com/new). A project is a centralized place of activity for the content built around a specific goal, deadline or production cycle. It can be anything from an issue of a publication to new copy for your company's website. This project will have its own life cycle, with metrics, notifications and version history tied to it. 

### Invite and manage team members 
Most content projects require other people to help create, edit, revise or approve the work. Once you have your account created, you can add in your team members to collaborate on all of your projects or to a specific project. 

You can manage your team or department using the [team tab](https://beegit.com/team) in the upper right side of your dashboard. You can set team members to be added to every new project you create and set their user roles to observer, editor or admin. You can also set their default email notifications here. You can add team members who already have a Beegit account or you can invite them by typing in their email address. **Note: once team members are added to this list, they will become available to be added as a collaborator on any projects that you own.**
