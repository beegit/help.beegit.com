## What are files and folders?

Files and folders are the fundamental elements of the files section. They can be easily created, renamed and deleted using the icons in the file toolbar above the file tree. Files and folders can be nested via drag and drop. 

### Working with files 
Files are documents that you create inside of a project. They are meant to be used with your normal organization workflow, acting as a single document for an entire project or as one of several documents.
