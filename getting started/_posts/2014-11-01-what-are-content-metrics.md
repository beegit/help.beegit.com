## What are content metrics? 
*Project metrics are only available on paid team plans, Plus or higher.*

Inside your project, you'll find a tab called Metrics. These metrics are an overview of your project progress. They show you how much work has been done in terms of hours spent by your team in Beegit's editor and how many words were added and deleted during that time. You can display data for the past week, month or the project's entirety.

You can filter this information even further by hitting the Group by User toggle, which will display the metric information by what each user contributed.
