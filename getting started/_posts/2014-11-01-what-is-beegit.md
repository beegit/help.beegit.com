## What is Beegit?
Beegit is the content-first project management solution for large and small teams. 

It helps users understand how their content team works and how it can work better by centralizing everything in one place, a collaborative web editor with light workflow tools. 

Teams can write on the web in a simple version control system and @mention teammates when content is ready for review or production. To keep the content adaptive, everything is formatted in Markdown, which is ready for common print and web formats. To make the team even better, the system produces some basic metrics on who did what during the project.
