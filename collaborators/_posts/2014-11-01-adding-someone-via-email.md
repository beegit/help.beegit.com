## Can I add a collaborator without a Beegit account? 
Yes, you can add a new collaborator to your Beegit projects using their email address. 

When you invite a new user to Beegit, you add them to your global collaborator list and then decide if you want them on every project or if you'd like to add them to just one or select projects. 

### Inviting a new user to all projects 
To add a new user to all your projects, select the `Add Collaborator` button in the collaborators section of your dashboard. 

This will let you type in the new user's email, set a user role for them - choosing observer, editor or admin - and decide on whether they should receive notifications on version creation and comments inside projects.

If you set this new user to be on all of your projects, you can still remove them from any individual project using the project Collaborators tab. 

If you've decided to add this collaborator to all of your projects, they will automatically be added to the next project you create. This setting does not retroactively put them on projects you previously created.

### Inviting a new user to select projects 
To add a new user to one or select projects, select the `Add Collaborator` button in the global collaborators section of your dashboard. 

This will let you type in the new user's email and set a user role for them --- choosing observer, editor or admin. Then, keep the Add to New Projects field set to no. This means this user will not automatically be added to your new projects. 

After you hit the Add Collaborators button, this user will be available to be added on any projects you own.

To add this new user to a project, go to the Collaborators section inside that project. There, you can add this new collaborator and set their user role specific to this project. Your users with the role of admin can also add collaborators to this project. 

When you add this new collaborator, they will get an email invite saying that they've been invited to work on a project with you.
