## How do I remove collaborators? 

You can remove collaborators from all the projects you own or an individual project. 

To remove them from all the projects you own, you can use the global collaborators list on your dashboard. To remove them from a single project, you can use the collaborators tab in that project. 

### Removing a collaborator from all my projects 
If you have a collaborator you would like to remove from all your projects, you can do that on your dashboard, using the global collaborators section. Simply click the `Edit` button for that collaborator and, when their settings appear, hit the red `Remove` button. You will get a warning message asking you to confirm this decision. If you confirm, this user will be removed from all of your projects.

After you remove a collaborator, all the content they added, every version they created and any comments they made will still exist.

### Removing a collaborator from a single project 
A project owner or admin can remove a collaborator's access from an individual project. To do so, visit the collaborators tab for a project and hit the red `Remove` button next to that collaborator's name. You will get a verification message that will confirm you want this collaborator removed. If you confirm, that collaborator will no longer have access to the project.
