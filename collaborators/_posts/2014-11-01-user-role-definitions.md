## What are the user roles? 
To manage teams and projects inside Beegit there are four basic user roles: observer, editor, admin and owner. 

An observer is a non-writing role that lets users watch a project and make comments on it. An editor is someone with the power to write an edit but they cannot change project settings. An admin has the right to write and edit and the ability to manage all project settings, but they do not have the authority to delete a project or manage a universal collaborator list. An owner is the person or organization who created the project and has full authority over the project collaboration list and settings, including the ability to delete a project. 

Here are more details on each user role. 

### Observer 
Observers are meant to be passive watchers of a content project. They can see project files, folders and history, but everything they see is a read-only. They cannot edit, change or delete anything. They can change their settings so that they receive notification emails when a version or comment is made. They can also be @mentioned in comments or versions.

### Editor 
Editors are users with the power to help create content, but they have very limited power in the project settings. They can create files and folders, edit content on any file, make versions and submit comments. They cannot remove collaborators, delete a project or file or change project settings like the project name or color.

### Admin 
Admins are both creators and managers in a content project. They can create and edit files, add users, change project settings like the name, short description and project color and make versions. They can also add or remove collaborators (including other admins) on the project level. They cannot delete a project.

### Owner 
The owner of a project is the person or organization who created the project. They can set the global collaborator list, including collaborator roles, and remove anyone from the project. They can write, edit and change project settings, and they are the only one with the authority to delete a project.
