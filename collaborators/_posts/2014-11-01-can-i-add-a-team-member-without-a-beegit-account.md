## Can I add a team member without a Beegit account? 
Yes, you can add a new team member to Beegit using their email address. This will then send them an email with instructions and a link to create a free account.

When you invite a new team member to Beegit, you add them to the team section of your dashboard, then specify if you want them on every project or if you'd like to add them to just one or select projects. 

### Inviting a team member to collaborate on all projects 
To add a team member as a collaborator on all your projects, select the `Add Team Member` button in the team section of your dashboard. 

This will let you type in the new team member's email, set a user role for them - choosing observer, editor or admin - and decide on whether they should receive notifications on version creation and comments inside projects.

If you set this new user to be on all of your projects, you can still remove them from any individual project using the project Collaborators tab. 

If you've decided to add this team member to collaborate on all of your projects, they will automatically be added to the next project you create. This setting does **not retroactively** put them on projects you previously created.

### Inviting a team member to collaborate on select projects 
To add a team member to one or select projects, select the `Add Team Member` button in the team section of your dashboard. 

This will let you type in their email and set a user role for them --- choosing observer, editor or admin. Then, keep the Add to New Projects field set to no. This means this team member will not automatically be added as a collaborator on your new projects. 

After you hit the `Add Team Member` button, they will be available to collaborate on any projects you own.

To add this team member to a project, go to the Collaborators section inside that project. There, you can add them to the project set their user role specific to this project. Your team members with the role of admin can also add collaborators to this project. 

After you add them, they will get an email invite saying that they've been invited to collaborate on a project with you.
