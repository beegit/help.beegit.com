## How do I add a team or collaborators to all my projects? 
You can create a list of collaborators that are automatically added on every new project you create. 

You can do this in the global collaborators section of your dashboard.

This is your list of global collaborators. Here, you can add new collaborators and see any you already have. You can add both new and existing collaborators to the list of users automatically included on all your projects. 

### Adding a new collaborator to all projects 
To create a new collaborator that you'd like to add to all of your projects, start by hitting the `Add Collaborator` button on your collaborator list on your dashboard. 

You can add this new collaborator by typing in their username or, if they are new to Beegit, by using their email address. Next, you'll set a role for them - observer, editor or admin. 

After that, you can decide if you want to add them to all your new projects. If this is a member of your team or organization that you work with regularly, you can select yes and they will automatically be added to every new Beegit project you create. 

Once you've made that decision, you can set their email notification preferences for your projects.

If you've decided to add this collaborator to all of your projects, the next project you create will feature them in your collaborators list. This setting does not retroactively put them on projects you previously created. 

### Adding an existing collaborator to all projects 
Even if a collaborator has only worked on one of your projects, they will appear in your global collaborators list on your dashboard. If you would like to add this user to all of your future projects, you can edit their settings. 

Start by selecting `Edit` on the right side of their collaborator profile. This will let you edit their settings. First, you can decide on a default role for them - choosing observer, editor or admin. 

Next, you can decide if you want to include them on every project. If you select yes, they will automatically be added to every new Beegit project you create. 

Once you've made that decision, you can set their email notification preferences for your projects. 

If you've decided to add this collaborator to all of your projects, the next project you create will feature them in your collaborators list. This setting does not retroactively put them on projects you previously created. 

### Adding or removing a collaborator on a single project
Regardless of your global collaborator list, you can always add or remove existing collaborators on a specific project by visiting that project's collaborators tab.
