## How do I add collaborators to a select project or projects? 

At the individual project level, you can add existing collaborators from your global collaboration list if you're the project owner or an admin on that project.

To do this, go to the collaborators section of the project and enter their username or email. 

You'll also need to set this collaborator's role, choosing from observer, editor or admin. This setting can be specific to this project, even if the user has a different role on the global collaborator list.

When you're finished, be sure to click the green `Add Collaborator` button. Once this collaborator has been added, the project will appear in their dashboard the next time they log in. You will also see their name and user role in the project collaborator list. 

If you want to add this collaborator to every project you create, use the global collaborator list on your dashboard. 

If you want to add a new collaborator to their first project, you must first invite them through your global collaborator list on your dashboard.
