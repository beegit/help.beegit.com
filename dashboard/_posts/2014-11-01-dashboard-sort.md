## How do I sort projects on my dashboard? 
Your project dashboard lets you quickly sort through every content project you're involved in - whether you own it or are a collaborator on it. You can sort by project owner, by specific details within an owner's projects or search for projects on your dashboard. 

### View and sort by project owner 
If you are involved in projects from multiple owners (for example if you have your own projects and projects for organizations or teammates), you can sort through all the projects you're on by selecting the project owner. You can do this by scrolling through the owner account names on the right-hand side of the dashboard. 

### Sorting by project details 
You can sort projects inside a set of owner's projects through multiple details. You can sort by last modified, oldest, project color, or alphabetically from A-Z or Z-A.

### Project search 
You can also search projects within a specific project owner view using the search bar at the top of the project list.
