## What is the project owner view? 
Your dashboard in Beegit can be sorted and viewed by project owner. 

If you own all of the projects you work on, the owner view won't change for you. If you collaborate with other project owners (for example, if you are a collaborator on a company or organization's account), you'll be able to switch through owners to view the projects you have access to.

Project owners are the ones who create collaborator lists for accounts and, ultimately, pay for those collaborators.

If you've been added to a collaborator list for a user but not to any of their projects, you'll see that owner on your dashboard but you won't have access to any of their projects. You'll need to contact them for access to a project.
