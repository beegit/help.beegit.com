## What is the dashboard? 
The dashboard is your landing place when you log into Beegit and it allows you to view your projects and collaborators.

You enter on your project list, which shows all of the projects you own or are a collaborator on. From your dashboard you can switch to the global collaborators list, which shows all the collaborators added to projects you own. 

If you are a new user without any projects, your dashboard will be blank. 

### The project dashboard 
Your project dashboard shows every project you're on, sorted by owner. If you own all of your projects, you'll just see your name in the right-hand navigation. If you are on projects with several owners, you can sort through the list of owners on the right-hand side to view projects by each owner. You'll always see the project owner you're viewing at the top of the dashboard.

Within the project owner view, you'll be able to sort and search the project list to easily find what you want to work on. After you've worked on a project for an owner, the dashboard will be set to that owner's projects the next time you log in. 

### Collaborator list
You can switch to your global collaborator list on the dashboard to view all your collaborators. This list shows people with whom you collaborate on projects you own. If you only collaborate on other people's projects, this list will be empty. 

If you are a project owner, you can use this collaborator list to set default teams or groups to be added to new projects or to manage notification settings for your collaborators.
