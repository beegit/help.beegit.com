## How do version notifications work? 

When someone makes a version, any project collaborator who has their default notifications set to on will get an email that a version was made that will include the text of the note.

If the person making the version wants to send a notification to a specific project collaborator, they can use an @mention, which will send them an email notification saying they've been mentioned. When a user starts to type an @mention in the version note, they will get a view of all the project collaborators to select which ones they want to mention.
