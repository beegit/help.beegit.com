## How do revision notifications work? 
When someone commits revisions, any project collaborator who has their default notifications set to on will get an email that a new revision was made that will include the text of the note.

If the person making the revisions wants to send an automated notification to a specific project collaborator, they can mention them by typing an "@" symbol inside the revision note and selecting the people they'd like to notify. This will send them an email notification saying they've been mentioned in a revision note, it will include a link to the project and will display the content of the revision note.
