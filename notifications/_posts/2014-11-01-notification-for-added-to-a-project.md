## Are people notified when they are added to a project? 
Yes, when an owner adds collaborators - either by putting them on their global collaborator list or adding them to a specific project - they are always notified via email. 

If the user is being added to a Beegit project for the first time, the email will tell them who invited them and ask them to activate their account.
