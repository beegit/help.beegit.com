## How do @mentions work? 
To send an email notification to a specific project collaborator, you can @mention them in both version notes and inline comments. When you type @ into the text box for either a version note or a comment, you'll get a list of project collaborators you can choose from.

These @mentions will send notifications to the project collaborators you call out, even if their default email notifications are set to off. The notification they receive will say who mentioned them and will include the text of the version note or comment.
