## How do comment notifications work? 
When someone makes a comment on a project, any cproject collaborator who has their default notifications set to on will get an email that a comment was made that will include the text of that comment.

If the person making the comment wants to send a notification for specific project collaborators, they can use an @mention, which will send an email notification directed at the collaborators mentioned. When a user starts to type an @mention, they will get a list of all the project collaborators to select which ones they want to mention.
