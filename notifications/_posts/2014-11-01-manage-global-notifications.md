## How do I manage my email notifications for all projects?
If you're a project owner, you can set the email notifications for everyone on your collaboration list by using the global Collaborators section on your dashboard. This will let you decide whether or not all of these users receive emails when a version is created or a comment is made. The default notification setting for both instances is not to send emails, but you can choose to turn them on for better project communication.

Regardless of your settings, anyone @mentioned in a version note or a comment will receive a notification email. 

Whether you are a project owner or a collaborator, you can change your notification preferences for versions and comments inside a specific project by visiting the settings tab in that project. 

### Adding users to a project 
You can add a collaborator to your collaborator list on your dashboard so they can be invited to any specific project. You can then add them to individual projects using the Collaborators section inside that project. Whenever you add a collaborator to a project, they are always notified via email. 

### Inviting new users 
You can add a new user to Beegit using their email address. If you invite a new user to their first project, they will receive an email saying they've been invited by you to collaborate on a project in Beegit.
