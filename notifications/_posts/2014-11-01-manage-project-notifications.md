## How do I manage my notifications on a project? 
Regardless of your user role, you can manage your email notification settings for a project inside that project's Settings tab.

Regardless of your settings, anyone @mentioned in a version note or a comment will receive a notification email.

### Adding users to a project 
When you add a collaborator to a project, they are always notified via email. 

### Inviting new users 
You can add a new user to Beegit via email in the Collaborators tab on your dashboard. If you invite a new user to their first project, they will receive an email saying they've been invited by you to collaborate on a project in Beegit.
