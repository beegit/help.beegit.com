## What is Markdown? 
Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax designed so that it optionally can be converted to HTML. Markdown is growing in popularity across the web for its flexibility and for its ability to format text once so that it can be used in multiple display outlets. 

Beegit uses Markdown for its simplicity and the extensibility it offers to export to not just HTML, but also print formats like Word and InDesign. It lets you apply basic formatting by adding a few punctuation characters. You can also use the formatting buttons at the top of the header.
