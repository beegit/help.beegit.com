## How do I change my account settings? 
You can update your account details by going to the [account settings](https://beegit.com/settings) section. To get there, click on your username and avatar in the top right corner of the site when you're logged in. 

Once on the account settings page, you can change your personal account information. Be sure to hit `Save` when you've made your changes. 

You can also update your password in the account settings. Be sure to hit `Update Password` when you've made your changes. 

### Where can I find my billing information? 
You can find your billing information in your account settings in the [billing tab](https://beegit.com/settings/billing). 

### Can I change my username? 
Your username is your unique identifier and cannot be changed in your account settings. If there is a problem with your username, please contact Beegit at [support@beegit.com](mailto:support@beegit.com). 

### What is Gravatar? 
Gravatar is a free service that provides you with a globally recognized avatar. You upload it and create your profile with Gravatar one time, and then when you participate in any Gravatar-enabled site (like Beegit) your Gravatar image will automatically follow you there. To change your Gravatar, visit [Gravatar.com](http://en.gravatar.com/).
