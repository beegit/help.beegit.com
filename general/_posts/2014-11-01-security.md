## Is my content safe in Beegit? 
Yes, very safe. 

Beegit is a secure site with 128-bit SSL encryption (note the green padlock in your browser) so you can feel comfortable transmitting your content data. 

If you're a project owner or admin, you can decide who will have visibility to any content you put inside Beegit, and you can remove a collaborator from a project at any time. 

Additionally, all content committed into a version on Beegit is stored in a Git repository that keeps each version safe. Customers of Beegit can request access to these repositories, meaning you always have a backup for and access to your content assets.
